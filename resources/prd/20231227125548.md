## Original Requirements

create a cli snake game with python

## Project Name

cli_snake_game

## Product Goals

- Develop a fun and interactive CLI-based snake game
- Ensure the game is easy to install and run on various systems
- Provide clear instructions and user-friendly interface

## User Stories

- As a player, I want to navigate the snake using simple keyboard controls
- As a player, I want to see my current score during the game
- As a player, I want the game to increase in difficulty as my score gets higher
- As a player, I want to be able to pause and resume the game

## Competitive Analysis

- Snake Game A: Basic functionality with keyboard controls, but no difficulty levels
- Classic Snake: Traditional gameplay, lacks modern features and enhancements
- Modern Snake Game: Advanced graphics, not CLI-based, high system requirements
- Python Snake CLI: Simple and functional, but with limited user instructions
- Retro Snake Terminal: Good performance, but poor scoring system and no pause feature

## Requirement Analysis

The game should be CLI-based, utilizing Python for development. It must include basic snake gameplay mechanics such as snake movement, growth, and collision detection. A scoring system and increasing difficulty levels are required to enhance user engagement. The ability to pause and resume the game should be considered for a better user experience.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement snake movement and keyboard controls']
- ['P0', "Develop a scoring system that reflects the player's performance"]
- ['P1', "Design game mechanics to increase difficulty as the player's score rises"]
- ['P1', 'Include a pause and resume feature']
- ['P2', 'Create comprehensive user instructions for game installation and play']

## UI Design draft

The user interface will be text-based in the CLI. It will display the snake, the food, and the current score in a straightforward layout. The game will use simple ASCII characters to represent the snake and food. Instructions for controls will be visible at all times.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific mechanics for increasing game difficulty need to be further defined. Whether it will be based on score thresholds, time intervals, or a combination of both is yet to be decided.
