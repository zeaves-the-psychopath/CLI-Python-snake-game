## Implementation approach

We will leverage Python's built-in libraries such as 'curses' for handling the terminal screen and keyboard inputs to create a responsive CLI environment. To keep the architecture simple, we will avoid unnecessary complexity and focus on modular design. The open-source library 'curses' is appropriate for this project as it is widely used for creating text-based interfaces and handling user inputs in a terminal setting.

## Program call flow

sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    participant SC as Score
    M->>G: start_game()
    loop Game Loop
        G->>S: move()
        alt Collision with Food
            S->>F: reposition()
            S->>S: grow()
            S->>SC: increase()
        end
        alt Collision with Wall or Self
            G->>G: end_game()
            M->>M: main()
        end
        G->>G: update_game()
    end
    M->>G: pause_game()
    M->>G: resume_game()

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific implementation details for increasing game difficulty are still unclear. We need to decide if this will be based on the snake's length, score milestones, or a combination of both. Additionally, the exact method for pausing and resuming the game within the 'curses' library needs to be researched.
